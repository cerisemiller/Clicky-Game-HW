# Clicky-Game-HW

This is a memory game using famous places from around the world! Users must remember where they've 'travelled' and cannot go to the same destination twice. After clicking on an image, all the locations will shuffle. You get a point for each image you click. However, if you repeat a destination you will lose the game and it will restart.

Good luck!

## Homework Instructions
For this assignment, you'll create a memory game with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

1. Create a new React application using Create React App.
2. The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.
3. The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
4. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
5. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
6. When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.
